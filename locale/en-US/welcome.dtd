<!-- LOCALE

     Format: language-COUNTRY according to RFC 1766
     ( http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt ). COUNTRY is for dialectal
     variation and is not necessary for locales without such variation. You can
     probably copy the locale tag of your localized Mozilla application
     (Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, etc.). Examples:

     en-US  - English in US
     en-GB  - English in Great Britain
     de-DE  - German in Germany
     ru     - Russian (no specific country)
-->
<!ENTITY locale "en-US">
<!-- LAYOUT DIRECTION: "LTR" for left-to-right; "RTL" for right-to-left.
     Generally, this should follow the direction of your writing system. -->
<!ENTITY layoutdirection "LTR">
<!-- WELCOME PAGE

     This needs a little care. There is some embedded markup (sorry about
     that). Of course, don't translate any text inside tags. The & lt; and
     & gt; codes produce < and > respectively, but don't reverse them; that
     will be done automatically for right-to-left text. & quot; produces a
     double quote character. Please substitute whatever is appropriate in your
     locale, but if you are editing this file directly, as opposed to using
     BabelZilla's interface, anything other than <, >, ", ', and & must be in
     UTF-8 or use numerical entities (e.g. & #x89ab;); named entities other
     than the ones for those five characters (& lt; & gt; & quot; & apos;
     & amp;) are NOT defined in this context. Double quote characters must be
     encoded as & quot; (again, if you are editing directly), since the
     strings are already double-quote delimited.
